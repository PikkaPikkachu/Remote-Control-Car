# Remote Control Car with Arduino 

## Introduction
This repository contains various arduino projects that were carried under "Indo-Spanish" project â€” a collaboration of Indian student from NSIT (under Dr. Pinaki Chakraborty) with Spanish Students from URJC university (under Dr. Cristina Rodriguez).


## Projects

- Introduction to Arduino : This was a brief introduction of Arduino and its working. 

- Traffic Light Signalling

- Air Conditioning

- Final Assessment: Remote Control Car :
For our final project, we built a remote control car simulation, the Spanish members implemented the same in hardware. The simulation can be found [here](https://www.tinkercad.com/things/i8wXkNHVHZt). 

## Car Design

The remote control car makes use of IR sensor and IR remote for sending and receiving signals. The design provides the following functionality: 

1. Move forward/Backward
2. Stop/Turn
3. Turn headlights on/off
4. Automatically turn LED on to signal stop 

Working on: 

1. Adding fan to prevent the car from heating up
2. Automatically turn headlights on during the night time

## Simulate
The simulation on TinkerCad can be found [here](https://www.tinkercad.com/things/i8wXkNHVHZt)."Fork" this simulation to your TinkerCad and start tinkering!  

## Feedback?
Our car design is open to suggestions/feedback. Open an issue and tell us what you think about our design !
